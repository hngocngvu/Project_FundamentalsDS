Macro-economic analysis and impact on the US Treasury Yields

Description: Treasury yields are among the key indicators of modern finance. They represent
the interest rate that the U.S. government pays to borrow money over a specific period by issuing and selling treasury securities. This project examines U.S. Treasury yields in relation to three macroeconomic elements: the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the unemployment rate, and the Federal Funds Effective Rate (FEDFUNDS), over the period from 2002 to 2025. Two critical events in this period are highlighted: the global financial crisis of 2007–2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020–2021.
